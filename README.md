# 🌿 Smart Plant Watering System (C Project)

> A simple simulation of an automated plant irrigation system using humidity and rain sensor logic – written in pure C.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **smart plant watering system** that continuously checks **humidity** and **rainfall** to decide whether to water a plant. It's a minimal demo often used in **IoT logic design**, **embedded systems practice**, or **environmental automation projects**.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Simulates environmental data (humidity & rain) using pseudo-random generation.
- 🚿 Waters the plant if humidity is too low.
- ☔ Automatically stops watering if it's raining heavily.
- 🔁 Real-time simulation with adjustable delay.
